* Revision history for circular
** Unreleased changes

** 0.3.1.1
Cabal changes, versioning changes.

** 0.3.1
- Change monadic folds so that commutativity is not anymore required.
- Provide =foldKM=, a fold over the last k elements on the stack.

** 0.3.0
- Bugfix =take=.
- Make functions more consistent (=fromVector= and =toVector= now both work on
  mutable stacks).
- Sort functions.
- Improve documentation.

** 0.2.0
- Complete rewrite using mutable vectors. A monadic interface is required now,
  but it is much cleaner in every other sense.
